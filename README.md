# 🧩 Mini Mission Simulator

> **A 3D tactical simulation of autonomous vehicles executing missions with real-time visualization and AI coordination.**

---

## 🧠 Overview
The **Mini Mission Simulator** is a flagship full-stack simulation project that blends **C++ backend physics and AI**, **React + Three.js 3D visualization**, and an optional **Python mission scripting layer**.

This project demonstrates scalable systems thinking, real-time rendering, and autonomous behavior design — mirroring how modern autonomy platforms like Applied Intuition approach simulation and mission control.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
| Layer | Technologies | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Backend** | C++17 / REST or WebSocket | Physics, AI logic, simulation core |
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, Three.js | 3D visualization & mission dashboard |
| **Optional** | Python | Mission scripting API or automation layer |
| **Tools** | VS Code, Git, CMake, Vite | Development & build environment |

## 🧭 Roadmap

### 🏁 Phase 0 — Project Setup & Architecture
- [x] Create clean multi-folder structure (`backend_cpp`, `frontend_react`, `python_tools`, `assets`, `docs`)
- [x] Initialize Git repos for backend & frontend
- [ ] Configure VS Code workspace and tasks
- [ ] Add initial README + `.gitignore`
- [ ] Build “Hello Simulation” app + 3D scene placeholder

✅ *Goal:* Functional skeleton with working builds and a connected pipeline.

---

### ⚙️ Phase 1 — Core Simulation Engine (C++)
- [ ] Implement entity system (drones, rovers, sensors)
- [ ] Add motion/physics stubs (position, velocity, heading)
- [ ] Build AI state machine (Idle / Patrol / Search)
- [ ] Parse mission JSON commands → simulate behaviors
- [ ] Stream data to frontend via WebSocket

✅ *Goal:* Backend simulates multiple entities and updates mission state.

---

### 🌐 Phase 2 — Interactive 3D Frontend (React + Three.js)
- [ ] Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project
- [ ] Integrate Three.js for map & object rendering
- [ ] Connect to backend data feed
- [ ] Render entities, detection cones, and trails
- [ ] Add mission control dashboard (stats + logs)

✅ *Goal:* Live 3D dashboard displaying real-time simulation.

---

### 🧠 Phase 3 — AI & Mission Logic Expansion
- [ ] Add pathfinding (A*) and obstacle avoidance
- [ ] Simulate detection and engagement behavior
- [ ] Enable formation logic (leader/follower roles)
- [ ] Add mission scripting layer (Python)
- [ ] Log telemetry and performance data

✅ *Goal:* Fully autonomous AI units executing search and patrol tasks.

---

### 🧩 Phase 4 — UI & Mission Planner Integration
- [ ] Mission Planner UI (draw routes, assign targets)
- [ ] Start / Pause / Reset mission controls
- [ ] Camera modes (map view, follow view, free cam)
- [ ] Analytics panel (charts, speed, detection rate)
- [ ] UI/UX polish (dark mode, animations, tooltips)

✅ *Goal:* Operator-style mission control with full interactivity.

---

### 🚀 Phase 5 — Polish & Deployment
- [ ] Optimize rendering & network performance
- [ ] Write documentation & developer guide
- [ ] Record short demo video / GIF
- [ ] (Optional) Dockerize backend
- [ ] (Optional) Publish Python mission-scripting tools

✅ *Goal:* Polished, public-ready simulation portfolio piece.

## 🌍 Future Enhancements
- Multi-domain missions (air + ground units)
- Environmental simulation (weather, terrain)
- Reinforcement learning for route optimization
- VR / AR visualization support
